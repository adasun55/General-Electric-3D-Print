# General Electric Metal 3D Printing Intelligence 
### *Developing predictive models to enhance the metal 3D printing process with sensor data* 

## Background 
Unlike the traditional manufacturing processes, additive manufacturing, also known as 3D printing, allows the creation of lighter, more complex, and economical designs that are too difficult or too expensive to build efficiently. 

## Collaboration
We have been working closely with **GE Additive**, the pioneering leader in additive design and manufacturing, and collaborating with UC Berkeley **Data-X** in order to increase manufacturing and operating efficiencies through explore improvements in metal 3D printing from a data science perspective. 

## Overall Approach
Our team has been working with data that was generated through experiments from a GE Additive metal 3D printing machine. The dataset with characterization results and camera data was created by the printing laser and recorded by the photodiode sensor camera through an experiment that consisted of single line prints. There are two metal powder layers with different melt pools in single lines with blocks and strips division. The objective from GE is to build the best predictive model for melt pool dimension (width, depth, height, total height) forecasting. Our work will help to reduce parameter iteration time for new pieces from months to weeks, improving metal 3D printing processes accurately and effectively. Promising results will be tested further at GE Additive to validate experimental results.
